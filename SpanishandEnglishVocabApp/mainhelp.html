	<h1>Spanish App Help</h1>
	
	<h2>Accented character help</h2>
	<p>
	To use accented characters on the iPhone, simply hold down the letter whose accented version you need, and in a moment it will pop up with 
	the accented versions of that letter.
	</p>

	 
	 <h2>Search Help</h2>
     <p>To use Search, tap on the Search tab, or simply open the Spanish App application. After that, 
     choose the direction that you want to search in by tapping "English to Spanish" or "Spanish to English". 
     To search, tap the search field, then type in the word you want to search for by tapping "Search". </p>
     <p>After you finish searching you can select one of the search results to work with that definition. If
     the search either doesn't find the word you were looking for, or the results do not match what you wanted,
     you can tap "Add word to dictionary" to add the word that you searched for to your personal dictionary.</p>
    <p><span style="font-color:red; font-weight: bold;">Important Note:</span> This application makes use of Google's
    translation API. When you are connected to the internet via 3G or Wifi, the Search feature will automatically look up
    translations from Google if there is not already a translation in your local dictionary. This feature is not guaranteed
    to always work due to the fact that it is a third-party service and that there is a limit to the number of characters
    that Google will translate per day. I included this feature simply as a convenience to help you to find translations 
    without having to leave the application. It should be noted, however, that Google's translation service still has many 
    inaccurate translations and that its results should not be trusted as authoritative. Whenever possible, please look up
    translations in a reputable dictionary.</p>
     
	 
	<h2>Management Help</h2>
    <p>The Management tab allows you to work with your personal dictionary. Use this feature to add, modify, or delete
    words that you don't want in your dictionary, to add or remove categories, or to move definitions to a different category.</p>

	
	<h2>Flash Card Help</h2>
    <p>Flash cards are easy to use: simply tap on the Flash card tab, choose whether you want to be shown the Spanish or the English first,
    then choose a category. You will be presented with a word from the category. When you know the translation or want to look at the answer,
    tap the screen and it will reveal the translation. When you are ready, tap the arrow to see the next flash card.
