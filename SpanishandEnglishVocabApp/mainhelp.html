	<h2>Accented character help</h2>
	<p>
	To use accented characters on the iPhone, simply hold down the letter whose accented version you need, and in a moment it will pop up with 
	the accented versions of that letter.
	</p>

	 
	 <h2>Search Help</h2>
     <p>To use Search, tap on the Search tab, or simply open the Spanish App application. After that, 
     choose the direction that you want to search in by tapping "English to Spanish" or "Spanish to English". 
     To search, tap the search field, then type in the word you want to search for by tapping "Search". </p>
     <p>After you finish searching you can select one of the search results to work with that definition. If
     the search either doesn't find the word you were looking for, or the results do not match what you wanted,
     you can tap "Add word to dictionary" to add the word that you searched for to your personal dictionary.</p>
     
	 
	<h2>Management Help</h2>
    <p>The Management tab allows you to work with your personal dictionary. Use this feature to add, modify, or delete definitions or categories, or to move definitions to a different category.</p>
    
    <h2>Adding or modifying words</h2>
    <p>When you are adding or modifying words, you can add the English and Spanish translations, assign it to a category, take a picture or use an existing photo to help you to learn the word, assign the part of speech, singular or plural, and masculine or feminine. You can also add an example sentence (I use this when I am reading a book in Spanish and come across a word that I don't know. I add the word and its translation and type in the sentence in which I found the word. This helps me to remember its context and can disambiguate words that are spelled the same, but which have different meanings based on context.) You can add an example for English and for Spanish. Don't forget to save!</p>

	
	<h2>Flash Card Help</h2>
    <p>Flash cards are easy to use: simply tap on the Flash card tab, choose whether you want to be shown the Spanish or the English first, choose where you want the photo to be displayed (if at all), choose if you want the English and Spanish examples to be shown, and then choose a category. You will be presented with a word from the category. When you know the translation or want to look at the answer,
    tap "flip" and it will reveal the translation. When you are ready, tap "next"  to see the next flash card. Flash cards are presented in random order and once you have viewed all of the cards in a category, it will start over, again in random order.
